### DO NOT USE SERIAL1! 
It will somehow cause the ESP32C3 to get stuck in a weird loop, rendering the MCU useless.

Instead, do:
```
#include <HardwareSerial.h>
MySerial0.begin(115200);
MySerial0.print("hello world");
```

### Breadboard Test
I connected the Seeed XIAO ESP32C3 to a Dynamixel MKR Shield board, and was able to get a test code running to control a Dynamixel motor through the ESP32C3. The main purpose is to contirm that the ESP32C3 hardware can indeed work with the Dynamixel2Arduino library provided by Robotis. Theoretically, I can use this same setup to control all motors on the current Q8 prototype, as long as I provide a sufficient power supply through the shield's screw terminal.

Connection (XIAO -> Shield):
- 5V -> 5V
- GND -> GND
- 3V3 -> VCC
- D6 (TX) -> D14
- D7 (RX) -> D13
- D8 -> A6 (TX_EN)
If using external power to run the DXL, remember to switch the jumper on the shield and disconnect the 5V line.
