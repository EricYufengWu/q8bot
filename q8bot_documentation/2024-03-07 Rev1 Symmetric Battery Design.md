By using two AA-sized cells (likely in parallel then boost to 5V), I came up with a fully symmetric iteration to the previous Rev chassis design. The two batteries will be attached to the chassis via spring contacts, which will be situated within the 3D-printed housing and soldered directly to the center PCB.

In this way, I can completely eliminate battery wires and connectors, both are potential weight addition and failure points. I can also then easily swap the batteries and charge them in a separate station.

Battery model: KeepPower 14500 (AA form factor, Li-ion, w/ protection circuitry)
