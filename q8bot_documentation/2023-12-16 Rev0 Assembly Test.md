The PCB is here, but I discovered I made a dumb mistake by accidentally connected TTL and VCC backwards... wonder how that happened :/

But, I decided to assemble the main robot body to test out the mechanical design anyway (also a new PCB is ordered and will arrive soon). I made another redesign to the main chassis 3D print and further reduced the weight of the plastic part.

Everything is almost perfect, except that I noticed some interference (0.16mm) between the green motor connectors and the plastic chassis, which caused the connector to tilt as I insert the motors in with some force. So in the new PCB I moved the connectors a little bit out of the way. It's no longer centered with respect to the motor's JST connector, but that's a compromise I have to take to make.


Another thing I did was to carve out part of the lower linkage to allow the leg to retract further.
