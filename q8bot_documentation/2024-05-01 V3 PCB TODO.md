2 PCB works pretty well in terms of layout (function wise yet to be fully tested), But there is already a list of things I would like to add to or improve on for a future version PCB.

- Tented vias (change Altium settings!).
- Can get rid of most TP now that the TTL circuit works.
- 5V fixed output for the boost converter. Delete the R divider and route FB directly to VIN.
- Plus sign for the tantalum capacitor.
- A good-quality switch for the battery or main power (if possible).
- Improved jumper selection system (consider a DIP switch?).
- Leave room for the u.fl antenna around the MCU.
- Move the battery hole location a tiny bit up...
- An easier way to access the boot and reset pin of the MCU.
