Received the PCBs a while ago and finally had enough components and time to assemble one to test.

I used a T4-grade solder paste from Chip Quik: SMD291AX10T4 and a small piece of squeegee to apply the paste. The stencil and PCB are both made by JLCPCB.

I than place the components carefully with tweezers. some of them looked pretty tine & are hard to tell orientation, but they are pretty manageable.

I then used a small hot plate from MiniWare to reflow solder the board - had to break it down to two jobs due to the size of the board, waiting for the hot plate to cool down in between the runs.

After reflow, I soldered the MCU (too big & protrudes the bottom so I couldn't use the hot plate) and the through-hole components, installed the front and back motor attachment brackets (3D-printed and with battery contacts), and installed 1 single motor to test. The TTL communication circuit appears to be functional! After receiving the inductor, I will try to test out the boost converter circuit as well. Next step: 8-motor test!
