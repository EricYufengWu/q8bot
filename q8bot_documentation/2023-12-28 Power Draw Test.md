### 3.7V
- Idle, torque-off: 130.8mA
- Idle, torque-on: 170mA - 800mA 
- Slow moving: <1.2A
- Jumping: 4.8A peak

### 5V
- Idle, torque-off: 131.5mA
- Idle, torque-on: 170mA - 650mA 
- Slow moving: <1A
- Jumping: 4.9A peak

### 6V
- Idle, torque-off: 132.5mA
- Idle, torque-on: 180mA - 550mA 
- Slow moving: <800mA
- Jumping: 5A peak

Slightly noticeable jumping performance @ 6V compared to 3.7V


**When moving up, the robot consumes more current since it is fighting against gravity to reach target position. Consider always "overshoot" and move down to position to save power.**
