Weird problem while running ESP-Now test code between the controller and the robot MCU:

With no interruption, the controller can send large packets of date at >100Hz to the robot controller with no problem. However, the communication becomes lagged once one of the following actions occur:
1. Manually pressing the reset button on the controller MCU
2. Unplugging the MCU
3. Stopping the serial monitor
4. Using the python script which fires rapid serial packets to the controller MCU
The lag is always a reduced, consistent speed in printing the received message.

To get out of the lag, I've found two ways. Both of them are hacks, so I need to fix this well before I can implement the rest of the code.
1. Re-uploading the same code.
2. closing and re-opening the serial monitor.

Solved!!
It seems like any serial print commands, including those in the OnDataSent() callback function or those triggered by a serial read command, could potentially trigger the unwanted behavior.


One thing that I still have yet to solve is how to clear the
