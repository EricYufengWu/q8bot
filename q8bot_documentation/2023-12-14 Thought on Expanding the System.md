PCB Robot - directly installing the Dynamixel XL series motor onto the PCB.

We currently have Q8bot - 8 DoF walking robot.

How about:
- Q2bot: simple line-following robot with two motors and a caster wheel, maybe some distance sensors or IR sensor.
- Q4bot: high-performance car robot with 4 motors.
- Q2draw: 5 bar linkage robot arm drawing onto a tiny touchscreen embedded on the main PCB.
- Q10bot: Q8bot plus 2 motor for wheel mode.
