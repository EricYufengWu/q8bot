# Q8bot python setup


<!-- ## Setup Instruction
Install dynamixel_sdk for python following this [instruction](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/python_windows/#python-windows)

For me, I set up dynamixel_sdk AFTER activating the venv of this project to make sure the library only applies here. -->

## Python venv instructions

It's is best to set up a virtual environment to prevent dependency conflicts between different projects (I'm using local python):

```python -m venv venv```

Run the following in the repo's directory to activate the virtual environment:

```.\venv\Scripts\activate```

When done, type ```deactivate``` to return to system python.
